# Fitbit Project

## Project Overview

This project is a Python-based fitness application that helps users track their health and fitness progress. The application consists of three main modules:

1. **BMI Calculator** - Calculates the user's Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their height and weight.
2. **Workout Tracker** - Allows users to log their workouts, including exercise type and duration.
3. **Body Measurement Tracker** - Helps users record and track body measurements, such as arm, waist, and legs.

All three modules are imported into a main script called "Fitbit_Track" for a better user experience.

## Features

* User-friendly command-line interface (CLI).
* BMI calculation with appropriate weight classification.
* Workout tracking with customizable exercise entries.
* Body measurement tracking with a summary report to view at the end.
